\chapter{Conclusions and Discussion}\label{final}
This project implements a Music Playlist generator and shuffling algorithm based on minimum user input using KNN model and different shuffling algorithms

For Playlist generation, Top k recommended songs of music recommendation system  are used as a playlist.

For playlist Shuffling, different shuffling algorithms likeFisher Yates,EtilistShuffling are used.

\section*{Future Directions}
This report gives rise to a number of important problems and possible optimization that need to be looked into further:
\begin{itemize}

\item {For the Playlist Generation, More advanced deep leaning based algorithm can be used.}

\item {For the Playlist Shuffling, Weights can be given to songs based on features like likeness to artist,genre,etc and then some weight based shuffling algorithm can be developed.}

\item {For the Playlist Generation, More explicit features like current user mood, genre, etc can be used. we could develop algorithms that will include these features. But for this data set is not easily available.}

\item {Also, Implicit features like music history, facial expressions, current time can also be taken but again data set becomes a problem. }


 \end{itemize}
