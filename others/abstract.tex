\textbf{Music Playlist Generation} : 
We presents an implementation of a playlist
generator using simple music similarity measure and heuristics. The goal is to create a music playlist given minimum user input. 

We have used Last.fm data set to train our model which comprises of play count of each artist for different users. It also contain basic info about each user like gender,age,country.

As user input, we have used Artist name that the user will like to listen. Then we  have implemented \textbf{ K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)} model to first generate top 10 most related artist to user query. These top 10 artist are used as the generated playlist which is then shuffled using different shuffling algorithms like \textbf{Fisher Yates,Etilist Shuffling}.
